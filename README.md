# DataProjectOne
Best project ever - team B

## Project Description
Our project is to uncover patterns in deeply personal, social preferences of users that would not be accessible from typical government data like census or CDC. We plan to explore relationships between religion, sexual orientation, substance use, drinking, smoking and other social identification and behaviors with user occupation, age, gender, income, etc.

### Potential areas for analysis
* age vs drinks vs drug
* age vs religion
* location vs sign
* age vs smoke
* height vs income
* income vs drinks vs drug
* income vs education
* body_type vs location
* ethnicity vs job or income
